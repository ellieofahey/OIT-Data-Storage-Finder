# OIT-Data-Storage-Finder

Welcome!

The three files attached are all required in order to launch the ND Data Storage Finder Site

The HTML file is in charge of content, displaying data storage options, and category filtering based on questions about data storage needs

The CSS file is responsible for the formatting, color display and font style/sizing for the page

The JavaScript file has the script necessary for the content filtering and will soon have added the flip card option for styling
